# [Bankruptcy-Prediction-Analysis](https://github.com/surya1203/Bankruptcy-Prediction-Analysis/blob/main/Bankrupcy%20Prediction%20Analysis%20KDD%20Project.ipynb)
Bankruptcy Prediction Analysis was our final project for CS 513 under Professor Khasha Dehand. The project was a binary classification problem, where we predict whether a company would go bankrupt (outcome: 1) or not (outcome: 0). The dataset was taken from kaggle, and was collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. The dataset has 96 columns and over 6000 instances.
